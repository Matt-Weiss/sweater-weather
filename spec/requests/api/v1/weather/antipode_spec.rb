# You will create an endpoint like so:, `/api/v1/antipode?loc=hongkong`
#
# You will use the `Amypode API` to determine the antipode for Hong Kong.
#
# [`http://amypode.herokuapp.com/api/v1/antipodes?lat=27&long=-82`]
#

#
# Your endpoint will give the user the original city, and the antipode's location name and its current weather summary and current temperature.
#

#
# You should reuse the code you have currently written for retrieving weather.
#
# Your response should resemble the structure and contain the following data:
